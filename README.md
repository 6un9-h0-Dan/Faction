# Faction C2 Framework

This repo contains the install script for Faction and serves as the general landing area for Faction issues. If you don't know where to put an issue, it goes here. 

Note that Faction is currently in BETA. It is buggy, but should be stable enough to start building stuff for it. 

For information on installing and using Faction, checkout the docs at https://www.factionc2.com/docs/
